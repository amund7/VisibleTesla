				The Notify Tab
			</h1>
			<p>
				The Notify tab allows you to request notifications when certain types of events occur. For example, if your state of charge (SOC) drops below a certain level or rises above a certain level. Note that in order to receive a notification, VisibleTesla must be running. If the app is sleeping, notifications may be missed or delayed. For more details, consult the <a href="SleepMode.html">Understanding Sleep Mode</a> section. As you can see in the screen shot below, the Notify Tab is split into several sections: Charging, Geofencing, and Other.  Each type of notification in each section can be enabled or disabled individually using the associated checkbox.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img class="screenshot" src="../images/24_Notify_Tab.png" alt="Notify Tab">
			</p>
			<p>
				Notifications are sent via email using the address specified in the <a href="PrefsTab.html">Prefs Tab</a>. Many wireless carriers provide an email-to-text gateway where you are provided an email address that corresponds to your mobile phone's phone number. Using such a gateway allows you to receive notifications as text messages. Please note that if you do so, normal text message rates may apply. Consult your carrier for details.
			</p>
			<p>
				Notifications are sent via a hosted service (MailGun). You don't need to enter your email credentials - just an email address. This need not be the same address that you use as your Tesla login. Messages are sent from the address "notifier@visibletesla.com". Do not reply to this address. It is not monitored. Advanced users may use their own MailGun account as described <a href="PrefsTab.html#mailgunkey">here</a>.

			<h2>Charge Notifications</h2>
			The screenshot below shows all of the charge and battery related notifications. Note that for the <span class="ui">Charge State Becomes</span> notification, you may open the drop down list to select the charge states of interest.

You can use this notification if you want to be alerted when your car reaches a certain charge level. Note that the SOC must cross a threshold to get to this value. For example, if you specify 85% as the target, the SOC must go from a value below 85% to 85% or above for a notification to be sent. A notification will not be sent if the SOC is already at or above 85% when the app starts up.

If you select <span class="ui">Anything</span> as the target value, then any change in the charge state will cause a notification. <span class="ui">Unknown</span> is a catch-all for any state that is unknown to VisibleTesla. The notification message will contain the current current state of charge (SOC) and estimated remaining range in appropriate units.

							A notification will be sent if something odd happens during a charge cycle. At the moment, the only anomaly that is detected is if your charging current or pilot current drops by 20% or more during the cycle. The drop must be sustained for a small number of minutes before a notification will be sent. The baseline from which the drop is detected is also established over a number of minutes. This notification will not be sent when using a supercharger since changes in current are normal. This feature is <strong>highly experimental</strong> since I have no way to safely recreate such a charge anomaly.

			<h2>Geofencing  Notifications</h2>
			Geofencing allows you to receive a notification when you car enters or exits a specific geographic area. As you can see in the screenshot below, you may specify up to four <b>Enter</b> notofications and four <b>Exit</b> notifications. Each notification can specify a different geographic area.

			<h3>
				<a name="locs">Defining Locations</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				When using the <span class="ui">Car entered area</span> or <span class="ui">Car left area</span> notifications, you must define the area of interest. An area is defined by a location and a radius which are set via an options dialog box. You get to that dialog box by pressing the <span class="ui">Define Area</span> button next to the <span class="ui">Car entered area</span> or <span class="ui">Car left area</span> checkboxes. The dialog you get looks like a normal Google map as shown in the screen shot below.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img class="screenshot" src='../images/24b_Map_Default.png' alt='Notify Tab'>
			</p>
			<p>
				You'll see a red arrow representing the selected location and blue circle around it representing the radius. The first time you bring up this dialog, the arrow will appear at the Tesla factory in Fremont, CA. Use the search box to navigate to a new location. As shown in the screen shot below, as you type you will see an auto-complete list of possible locations.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img class="screenshot" src='../images/24c_Map_Auto.png' alt='Notify Tab'>
			</p>
			<p>
				Choose one of those locations or hit <span class="ui">Enter</span>. The map will relocate to show the selected location as shown below. Now you can begin to refine the location and radius. Use the normal map controls to zoom and pan as needed. To relocate the arrow, simply click and drag it to a new location. To change the radius, grab the white knob and drag it in or out. The blue circle will grow or shrink to show the new radius. VisibleTesla will not allow you to set a radius below 15 meters.
			</p>
			<p>

			</p>
			<p>
				<img class="screenshot" src='../images/24e_Map_Manipulate.png' alt='Notify Tab'>
			</p>
			<p>
				When you've got the location and size the way you want them, enter a nickname for this location such as Home or Work. The nickname will be used as part of notification messages. If you don't enter a nickname you may see a latitude / longitude in notification messages. After setting the nickname, just press <span class="ui">OK</span>. You can cancel at any time by pressing the <span class="ui">Cancel</span> button. In this case your previous values will not be changed.

Normal fluctuations in your driving might cause you to drop below then go above 75 mph many times. VisibleTesla will not issue a notification each time that happens. It will issue the first notification and then will not issue another until at least 30 minutes passes.

			<p>
				Some readings can vary slightly over a short period of time which could, in theory, cause multiple notifications. For example, say that you asked to be notified whenever your SOC drops below 50%. If your SOC is hovering right around 50% and you fall below, you'll get a notification. If you go down a big hill and regeneration brings your SOC back up to 50%, you're likely to get another notification again very soon. VisibleTesla will avoid sending multiple redundant notifications in these cases.
			</p>
			<h2>
				<a name="custom_messages">Customizing Notifications</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				VisibleTesla allows you to optionally specify the email address, subject and message body to use for each type of notification. The email address may be a comma-separated list of addresses if you'd like the message to go to more than one recipient.
			</p>
			<p>
				Custom notifications can be useful in a number of circumstances. For example, you may wish to use email notifications for most things, but use text messages for urgent notifications. For urgent notifications you could enter a text message address instead of your default email address. You could also use this feature if you wish to develop mail rules that kick off some activity based on a recipient email address and/or subject line.
			</p>
			<p>
				To access these options, press the <span class="ui">+ button</span> at the far right of any notification definition. A dialog will pop up (see below) allowing you to specify an email address, subject, and message.
			</p>
			<p>
				You may also select <span class="ui">Use default values</span>, in which case the default email address, subject, and message will be used. If you leave any field blank, the default will be used for the blank item(s).
			</p>
			<p>
				<img class="screenshot" src='../images/24a_Notify_Options.png' alt='Notify Tab'>
			</p>
			<h3>
				Defining your own message using variables
			</h3>
			<p>
				By default, VisibleTesla sends notification messages that include information relevant to each type of notification. For example, if you set up a <span class="ui">Speed Hits or Exceeds</span> notification, the app will tell you both the target speed (e.g. 75 mi/h) and the current speed (e.g. 80 mi/h).
			</p>
			<p>
				You may want to customize the message that is sent for a given notification to include different information, different text, or use your native language. To facilitate that, VisibleTesla allows you to set a custom message as described above. However, to make that message meaningful, you'll need to specify the information you'd like to include such as the current speed, target speed, or state of charge. You can specify those values by using special keywords in your message. Those words are listed below and are always delimited by double curly braces: {{ and }}. We refer to these keywords as variables.

			<p>
				Let's look at an example. Say we want to add a custom message to the <span class="ui">Charge State Becomes</span> notification. We want it to tell us the new charge state, the SOC, and the ideal and rated ranges. We could enter a message that looks like this:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<code>{{DATE}} {{TIME}}<br>
				Charge State: {{CHARGE_STATE}}<br>
				SOC: {{SOC}}%<br>
				Range ({{D_UNITS}}): Rated={{RATED}}, Ideal={{IDEAL}}</code>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				This might produce a message such as:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<code>2014-06-03 10:00:00<br>
				Charge State: Complete<br>
				SOC: 90%<br>
				Range (mi): Rated=177, Ideal=184</code>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				You can use as many or as few variables as you'd like and they don't have to be related to the particular type of notification. For example, you can include the estimated range and/or SOC in every notification that you send.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can also use variables in subject lines. Let's look at a couple of examples that might be used for the <span class="ui">Charge State Becomes</span> notification:
			</p>
			<table class="grid_table">
				<tr>
					<th>
						Subject field
					</th>
					<th>
						Example output
					</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
						<code>Charge State: {{CHARGE_STATE}}</code>
					</td>
					<td>
						<code>Charge State: Stopped</code>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
						<code>Charge State: {{CHARGE_STATE}}, SOC: {{SOC}}%</code>
					</td>
					<td>
						<code>Charge State: Stopped, SOC: 80%</code>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>: Variable names must be entered exactly and must always include the double curly braces. <code>{{Soc}</code> is not a substitute for <code>{{SOC}</code>; nor is <code>SOC</code>. It really needs to be an exact match to the items listed in the table above. You may not use double curly braces as part of the content of your message. Anything enclosed in double curly braces will be interpreted as a variable name.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Advanced Feature: Messages for use in custom html pages
			</h3>
			<p>
				Variables can also be used by custom pages generated by the built in <a href="OtherTopics.html#rest">web services</a>. These variables, listed and described in the table below, generate snippets of HTML rather than plain text. Of course the plain text variables listed above can also be used in html pages.

			<h2>
				Accessing a URL: Advanced Users Only
			</h2>
			<p>
				When a notification occurs, VisibleTesla can perform an <code>HTTP GET</code> on a URL instead of sending an email. This mechanism allows notifications to trigger web services for home automation or other purposes. To use this feature, set the notification email in any custom notification setting to a URL rather than an email address. The URL must begin with <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code>. It must be a fully formed URL with any special characters URL-encoded. If VisibleTesla sees a URL rather than an email, it will perform an <code>HTTP GET</code> on that URL. It <strong>will not</strong> check error codes returned from the server nor process any returned data. The custom subject field will be ignored.
			</p>
			<p>
				A sample use case might be turning on outside lights at your home when your car is approaching. To do this you would start by setting up the <span class="ui">Car entered area</span> notification. You would then press the <span class="ui">+ button</span> to bring up the custom address dialog as shown below. Now you can enter the URL corresponding to the "Lights On" command of your home automation controller. Put it in the <span class="ui">EMail</span> field where you would normally put an email address.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img class="screenshot" src='../images/24g_Enter_Custom.png' alt='Notify Tab'>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Security Note:</strong> Any information you enter in this field will be stored unencrypted on your computer's local disk. Be aware of that if you encode sensitive information into a URL.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Executing a Command: Advanced Users Only
			</h2>
			<p>
				When a notification occurs, VisibleTesla can exeute an arbitrary command rather than sending an email. This provides a very high degree of flexibility in what can be done as the result of a notification. The command executed by VisibleTesla could integrate with another service, log information, perform calculations - you name it.
			</p>
			<p>
				You get to specify three things when setting up this type of notification:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The command name: [required] The command name is entered in the <span class="ui">EMail</span> field of the Notification Options dialog. It must be a fully qualified path to the command of interest. Make no assumptions about the working directory from which this command will be launched. The name of the command must be prefixed by <code>command:</code>. For example:
					<blockquote>
						<code>command:/usr/bin/curl</code>
					</blockquote>
				</li>
				<li>Arguments: [optional] You may specify arguments to the command using the <span class="ui">Subject</span> field of the Notifications Options dialog. You may use VisibleTesla variables as described above. For example, you could enter:
					<blockquote>
						<code>power={{C_PWR}}</code>
					</blockquote>
				</li>
				<li>Standard Input: [optional] If you'd like your command to receive input on stdin, you can specify it in the <span class="ui">Message</span> field of the Notifications Options dialog. You may use VisibleTesla variables as described above. For example, you could enter:
					<blockquote>
						<code>
							{{DATE}} {{TIME}}<br>
							Charge State: {{CHARGE_STATE}}<br>
							SOC: {{SOC}}%<br>
							Range ({{D_UNITS}}): Rated={{RATED}}, Ideal={{IDEAL}}
						</code>
					</blockquote>
				</li>

				<strong>Notes</strong>: 
				<ul>
					<li>VisibleTesla will continue executing in parallel with your command. Your command will be launched in the background and VisibleTesla will immediately continue normal operation.</li>
					<li>VisibleTesla will not check the result of your command or read any output it generates. If you wish to capture stdout or stderr, you should do that in your command. This may require that you wrap your command in a shell/bat script. In that case, specify the path to your script as the command name.
					</li>
					<li>VisibleTesla will give your command about a minute to execute. If it hasn't completed by then, the process will be killed.
					</li>
